(Spear)What has brought you here, creature?
(Spear)Was it just random chance?
(Spear)Or were you too brought here by visions from the abyss?
(Spear)I once held a fascination for this place, its history, its knowledge.
(Spear)Now roaming these corridors feels nostalgic.
(Spear)I spent so much of my time here.
(Spear)Studying, measuring, hypothesizing.
(Spear)And I'm now supposed to just let it go?
(Spear)Act like it never happened?
(Spear)How would one even achieve that?

(Artificer)I see you.
(Artificer)You do not belong here.
(Artificer)This place is incompatible with your hate.
(Artificer)Then again, in this place, far from those who have wronged you,<LINE>perhaps you can learn to forgive.
(Artificer)It's only up to you.

(Red)I can feel your pain, little one.
(Red)Know that it's not yet over for you. 
(Red)Take this gift and keep descending.
(Red)Perhaps you can do what I could not.

(Gourmand)What would someone like you make of this place?
(Gourmand)I was once fascinated by these ruins.
(Gourmand)So many questions, so little answers. 
(Gourmand)Do you feel the same way about the things we left behind?
(Gourmand)A cycle within a cycle.
(Gourmand)Eventually, some other creature will emerge and investigate the things your kind left behind.
(Gourmand)I wonder just how deep beneath the earth our creations will be by then.
(Gourmand)And the ruins we are standing on?
(Gourmand)Gone, erased as if they never existed in the first place.

(White)You! 
(White)Come, sit down with me.
(White)What do you think makes this place hallowed?
(White)Is it its proximity to the void?
(White)The vegetation?
(White)Some ancient technology?
(White)I pondered this question for countless cycles when I was whole, and for even more countless cycles now.
(White)Even though the answer no longer matters.
(White)Still, I can't help myself.
(White)Why is this place different?
(White)The answer has to lie in here somewhere.
(White)It has to.

(Yellow)Yet another creature!
(Yellow)I'm growing rather fond of being visited by your kind.
(Yellow)But it wasn't only your kind.
(Yellow)All sorts of different beings have traversed these holy grounds throught my semi existence.
(Yellow)...
(Yellow)Can someone like me continue to make memories? 
(Yellow)Continue changing despite my predicament? 
(Yellow)I certainly hope so.

(Rivulet)Another one is here, it has certainly been a long time.
(Rivulet)Come.
(Rivulet)Stay a while.
(Rivulet)...
(Rivulet)I've made peace with the fact that I'll never understand this place.
(Rivulet)This place is,
(Rivulet)and I am.
(Rivulet)And that's good enough.

(Saint)Can you feel it? 
(Saint)The void is really close now. 
(Saint)Soon this area will no longer exist, and who knows what will happen to me. 
(Saint)Everything comes to an end eventually.
(Saint)Do you think I will finally get to join my peers?

(Inv)...
(Inv)...
(Inv)This region fucking sucks.
(Inv)I want a refund.
(Inv)Do you know how i can contact customer service?

(Pearlcat)You are a fellow archaeologist, aren't you?
(Pearlcat)I sense your collection,<LINE>each pearl has its own story to tell.
(Pearlcat)The fate of so much information is in your hands.
(Pearlcat)And yet you can't access it yourself, can you?
(Pearlcat)...
(Pearlcat)In the now dilapidated laboratory lies a pearl I think you'll like.
(Pearlcat)It has undergone a fascinating transformation.
(Pearlcat)Harness its secrets.

(Gravelslug)What are you?
(Gravelslug)You are the strangest thing to enter my sphere of influence.
(Gravelslug)...
(Gravelslug)I see you.
(Gravelslug)It seems you'll beat me on our race to the bottom.
(Gravelslug)I hope to see you at the finish line.

(Incandescent,Begonia)...

(thedronemaster)Thinking you can brute force your problems with technology is the kind of foolishness my kind engaged in.
(thedronemaster)It didn't work out for them.
(thedronemaster)And i doubt it will work out for you.
(thedronemaster)Cease your violence.
(thedronemaster)This system doesn't react well when its balance is disrupted.

(Vinki)I BETTER NOT SEE YOU GRAFFITI THESE RUINS
(Vinki)THESE ARE PRICELESS ARTIFACTS
(Vinki)YOU HEAR ME?

(Speedrunner)I see you're in a hurry.
(Speedrunner)Are you sure this is the optimal path?
(Speedrunner)Hang on,<LINE>let me get my map
(Speedrunner)...
(Speedrunner)Wait, are you trying to avoid going through filtration system?
(Speedrunner)Did you install a region mod just to avoid it?
(Speedrunner)That's no good, you can't just run from your problems.
(Speedrunner)Well you can but you know what I mean.

(Beacon,Photomaniac)You're looking at the one and only A Meadow of Mountains, Unchecked!
(Beacon,Photomaniac)If only you knew what that meant, little blue... thing.
(Beacon,Photomaniac)Everyone in the local group knew my name!
(Beacon,Photomaniac)My technique and style were unparalleled!
(Beacon,Photomaniac)No one could surpass me!
(Beacon,Photomaniac)And yet...
(Beacon,Photomaniac)Here I am.
(Beacon,Photomaniac)I was warned that my hubris would prevent me from leaving this plane and I didn't listen.
(Beacon,Photomaniac)But I regret nothing!
(Beacon,Photomaniac)I lived a full life and if my "death" was far from ideal then so be it.
(Beacon,Photomaniac)I'll reminisce about my glory till the end of time!

(MMWingcat,Outsider)You've strayed far from your natural environment.
(MMWingcat,Outsider)These claustrophobic chambers are hardly fitting for a winged creature.
(MMWingcat,Outsider)In that way we're more alike than you might think.
(MMWingcat,Outsider)Such is the nature of exploration and discovery.
(MMWingcat,Outsider)We only reach new places by pushing the boundaries of what is possible, one step at a time.

(NCREntropy)You come into MY house and tell me how to arrange MY furniture?
(NCREntropy)What a fool you are.
(NCREntropy)SKELETON DIVINE DEATH BLAST!

(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)The people who built this place, they were like us.
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)They had their own hopes and dreams, as well as anxieties and fears.
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)They had ideologies that clashed, culture that shifted over time, heroes they looked up to and villains they hated.
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)And yet it's all lost to time.
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)We can only see glimpses of what they were like from what little remains.
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)And that's also us now, isn't it?
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)We are not here anymore, we can't tell our story.
(guide,darkness,CowBoySLug,slugSpiderDartSleep,PorcupineCat,Estranged,LancerMonk,MaulCat)It's up to whatever intelligence comes next to remember us, and our predecessors too.
