"Hello Moon.
I'm running out of power.
I've been trying to reach you to see if you could send me replacement parts, but I see that that's not going to be possible.
I don't know for sure what's going on up there but I know it's bad. 
Since this is likely the last time you'll hear from me I thought I'd give you this thing I made to remember us by.
Take care.
-SIU"
There's an image attached of me, pebbles, SIU and who I think are the Pilgrim's lab's research team.

Poor SIU, it deserved better.
We all do.
