It's a "formal" complaint from Five Pebbles to the Exoland Management Department in his city, I'll read it to you:
"I'm not going to bother with formalities now, you need to stop allowing junk to be deposited on the underground protected areas immediately.
Not only are you dumping souvenirs on what's supposed to be a nature sanctuary but you are throwing off the karmic balance that gives this region its properties.
Both me and Looks to the Moon have been measuring and analyzing the effects<LINE>and we are in agreement that disturbing the system too much will have unpredictable consequences which at best could neutralize the region's karmic effects and at worst could make the region entirely uninhabitable.
Any perceived benefit of leaving random items there is not worth the risk, if you don't take action and the region is lost then I will prosecute you all both as individuals and as a group."
A bit harsh but he was correct in his assessment.
If you're curious what happened next, for the most part we got ignored and several sections of the region ended up compromised, as in you couldn't go in without protective equipment or you'd risk serious injury or worse.
There likely are sections that are still like that to this day, though with diminished effects.
Well, at least Five Pebbles got to have fun on the courts, you don't get to see such clear cut cases of negligence often.
