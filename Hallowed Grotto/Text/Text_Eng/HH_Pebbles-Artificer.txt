It's a formal complaint I made to the ones in charge of managing surrounding lands.
They were turning a blind eye to the local custom that emerged of leaving stuff on the hallowed underground so it'd be imbued in holiness or whatever, such actions were causing instability in the karmic balance of the system.
They ignored me and large parts of the cave system became essentially uninhabitable and no one was allowed to go in.
On the other hand I did get all the people involved fired and they finally approved the construction of an on site laboratory to research and monitor the place better so there's that.
