You? On hallowed grounds? That would be an interesting sight.
This pearl is "enlightened" as my creators would put it, only slightly so, mind you. 
If you are wondering how a pearl can be enlightened so do us all,<LINE>it is one of the many mysteries of karmic enlightenment.
How can an object, which has no thoughts or free will become more or less able to ascend? 
My creators expected us to figure it out, as they were unable to do it themselves.
That's rich of them.
It's an interesting find, small one, but I have other matters to attend to.
