This is a map of the natural caverns found deep underground, south of my facility.
There's supplementary information here that claims that this was to be used to extract natural Wheel flowers for use in the local farm, as well as for those who wouldn't settle for anything less than the holiest of flowers.
Some people believed that growing flowers entirely artificially would eventually rob them of their special properties so they regularly went on expeditions to retrieve new ones, from the holiest natural place of course.
These "purer" flowers would be bred so they could eventually replace the old ones, which was a slow process.
It was all an exercise in theatrics if you ask me but I'm unable to actually consume them so I wouldn't know if there was an actual difference in effect or not.
