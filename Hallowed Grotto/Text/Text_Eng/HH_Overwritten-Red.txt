Have you been to the holy site, little creature?
When our creators were around they frequently sent us material from there so we could analyze it,<LINE>the material that had been there a long time had this "energy" infused within it,<LINE>it's hard to describe without getting technical.
This is a very interesting find because this pearl has been abandoned there long enough for it to be affected.
The pearl was not originally green, subsurface data imply this pearl was originally white,<LINE>even stranger though is that the information inside it has been partially overwritten with a vision of lights moving erratically on a completely black environment.
There's a lot of information about the local laboratory on the unaffected parts, but it's just records of everything that has ever entered and left the facility,<LINE>nothing particularly interesting and a lot of the data is in a pretty bad state.
If I was still fully operational I would analyze it further but this is all I can do now.
