It's a vision of lights moving erratically in a completely black environment.
It's very odd though, you'd expect a pearl to be faded at this point but this one is the opposite, being as clear as the day it was made.
The engraving is so strange too...
Where did you get this?
...
Well I suppose I'll never know.
...
Weird
Looking at this vision, it almost feels like I've seen it before.
Keep this pearl safe, will you?
