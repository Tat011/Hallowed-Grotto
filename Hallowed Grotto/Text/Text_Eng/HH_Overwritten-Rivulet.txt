This pearl contains only an image of lights moving erratically on a completely black environment.
Though the method used to engrave this vision on it is very strange as it's uniformly applied to the entire thing.
...
Actually there's some kind of information on the very center of the pearl, but it's extremely corrupted so I can't tell what it says.
Was this made by someone who was new to pearl editing? Is it intentionally like this? Did some external force scramble the data?
It's impossible to tell unfortunately.
