This pearl contains a list of spots where Wheel Flowers grow in the wild, with statistics like speed of growth, accessibility and replenishment rate.
There's supplementary information here, it reads:
"The information found herein is for extraction of untamed Wheel Flowers for usage in replenishment of the ever sacred garden's karmic balance,<LINE>in addition to personal consumption of the most devout of monks (may they attain a peaceful ascension).
The extraction of these (and all!) resources MUST abide by the standards set by the Citadel's 'Ethical, sustainable & traditional extraction of hallowed resources' decree, lest we upset the karmic balance of the region."
I'd tell you more but I wasn't really involved in any of this and my memory isn't what it used to be.
