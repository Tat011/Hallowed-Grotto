Seven Lights, Mountains Abound: Botanist.
An Eclipse under a Siren: Microbiologist.
Endless Space, Meager Appliances: Engineer.
Three Diamonds by the Mirror: Software Engineer.
Blooms at Night, Atop the Mountain: Archaeologist.
I'm not familiar with most of these except Five Blocks of Wood who lived in my city.
They were... an interesting personality.
Besides being an expert in their field which was the minimum requirement<LINE>they were known for being an uncompromising hard-liner which is why they were selected as a member.
It's probably not the best qualifying feature but it was a highly sought out one by groups who engaged in spiritual matters.
It was also important to bring someone who could rein the others in<LINE>as they are all from very different fields and have very different motivations.
I hope they did a good job but most of my memory files on this person are corrupted so i wouldn't know.
