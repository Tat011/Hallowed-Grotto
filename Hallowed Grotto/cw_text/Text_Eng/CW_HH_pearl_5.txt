This pearl contains a log of the people working in a laboratory called Pilgrim's Lab.
It goes as follows:
Five Blocks of Wood, Infinite Symbols: Karmic Scientist.
One Hatchet, Three Opportunities: Geologist.
Ten Seas, Three Needles: Zoologist.
Seven Lights, Mountains Abound: Botanist.
An Eclipse under a Siren: Microbiologist.
Endless Space, Meager Appliances: Engineer.
Three Diamonds by the Mirror: Software Engineer.
Blooms at Night, Atop the Mountain: Archaeologist.
One Hatchet, Three Opportunities is from my city.
Well, they weren't born here but moved here to study the natural landscape surrounding my facility before working at Pilgrim's Lab.
The terrain around my can was of high interest to geologists back in the day,<LINE>lots of them settled here as a result and the high amount of them caused them to form their own micro-culture.
Those were interesting times.
