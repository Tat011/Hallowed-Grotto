It's a complaint from Five Pebbles to the Exoland Management Department in his city, It goes:
"I'm not going to beat around the bush here, you need to stop allowing junk to be deposited on the underground protected areas immediately.
Not only are you dumping souvenirs on what's supposed to be a nature sanctuary but you are throwing off the karmic balance that gives this region its properties.
Both me and Looks to the Moon have been measuring and analyzing the effects and we are in agreement that disturbing the system too much will have unpredictable consequences<LINE>which at best could neutralize the region's karmic effects and at worst could make the region entirely uninhabitable.
Any perceived benefit of leaving random items there is not worth the risk,<LINE>if you don't take action and the region is lost then I will prosecute you all both as individuals and as a group."
Pebbles was not messing around it seems, I'd wonder what got him so worked up but knowing a disaster is coming and yet not being able to stop it is gonna frustrate anybody.
Especially when it's due to the decisions of others.
