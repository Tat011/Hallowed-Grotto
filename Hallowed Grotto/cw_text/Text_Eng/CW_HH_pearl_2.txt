This pearl is a map with highlighted spots where Wheel flowers grow in the wild, with statistics like speed of growth, accessibility and replenishment rate.
There's supplementary information here:
"The information found herein is for extraction of untamed Wheel Flowers for usage in replenishment of the ever sacred garden's karmic balance,<LINE>in addition to personal consumption of the most devout of monks (may they attain a peaceful ascension).
The extraction of these (and all!) resources MUST abide by the standards set by the Citadel's 'Ethical, sustainable & traditional extraction of hallowed resources' decree,<LINE>lest we upset the karmic balance of the region."
I assume this is from the "True Anointed Citadel" Pebbles was built over,<LINE>it's not particularly surprising that they grew Wheel flowers considering their religious status but it is surprising that they'd take fresh ones from hallowed grounds.
The monks on my can would've had a thing or two to say about that.
