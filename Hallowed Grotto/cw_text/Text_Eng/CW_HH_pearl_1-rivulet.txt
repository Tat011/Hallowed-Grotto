This pearl is strange, it shows textbook signs of karmic elevation.
I never got many samples of "holy" material and I've certainly never seen an artificial object experience this.
Theseare formed in elevated systems, I assume the pearl is from the one south of Five Pebbles as it’s the closest one I know of.
The data within has been partially overturned by some kind of image of lights bobbing in the dark,<LINE>it reminds me of those tales mystics preached of people who spent too much time deep underground dreaming of moving lights floating in nothingness.
If you leave this with me I'll be sure to study it but you can take it if you really need it.
